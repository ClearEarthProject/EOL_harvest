Python 2.7

All the code is in harvest_text.py
The "id" files are a deduped list of all the unique EOL taxon ID numbers that can be used
to look up information with the API. There are over 4 million IDs.
The replacedict.txt is a dictionary used in the code to replace some troublesome 
characters in the harvested text.
